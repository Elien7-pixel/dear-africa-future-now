  'Fueling Change: Youth Innovator Converts Used Cooking Oil into Clean Diesel',
  'Growing up in Limpopo, South Africa, Mahlatse Mamaila witnessed high youth unemployment and growing waste pollution. Her solution? INO-Biodiesel - transforming used cooking oil into 100% clean biodiesel while creating jobs and fighting climate change.',

Growing up in Limpopo, South Africa, I witnessed two pervasive issues: a high rate of youth unemployment and an ever-growing pile of waste and pollution that tarnished the beauty and health of our communities. I felt a compelling urge to address both problems, but at that time, I didn''t know how.

My journey began with an article I read about the advantages of waste oil. This insight coincided with the harsh realities many of my peers faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, as unemployment soared and students dropped out of university. These challenges motivated me to launch a green business: INO-Biodiesel. We collect used cooking oil—a substance most people discard—and transform it into 100% clean biodiesel. This renewable fuel powers vehicles without the toxic emissions associated with fossil diesel. Each litre we produce not only diverts harmful waste from landfills but also significantly reduces carbon emissions while creating jobs for collectors, drivers, and processing staff.

The concept of Trash-Converter Climate-Tech takes our mission a step further. Here, community members, particularly young people, bring in recyclable materials such as plastics, cans, and paper. In return, they are compensated with Trash-Converter, a digital currency that can be exchanged for cash, airtime, or groceries. It''s remarkable to witness how quickly people''s mindsets shift when waste is transformed into a source of income.

For me, this work extends beyond business; it embodies dignity and empowerment. It''s about a young woman in Mpumalanga who can now pay her child''s school fees by collecting recyclable plastic. It''s about a group of women in North-West Province who have formed a cooperative around waste oil collection. It''s about demonstrating that climate action can indeed put food on the table.

To anyone wondering how they can contribute to fighting climate change in Africa, my advice is straightforward: start with the problems in front of you. Seek solutions that address both environmental and economic challenges. Collaborate with others, embrace new technologies, and remember that small actions—like teaching people to recycle or switching to cleaner fuel—can lead to substantial change.

Africa''s climate challenges are immense, but our creativity and resilience are equally formidable. By linking environmental protection with income generation, we can achieve more than just saving our planet; we can build thriving, sustainable communities.',
